3D Printing Basics:
  * 3D printers work by extruding material (hot plastic, metal, chocolate, etc.) layer-by-layer.
    -  We’ll be using 1.75mm PLA - Polylactic Acid, extruded at ~220°C (430°F).
  * Most prints start with a 3D object file (.stl, .obj, .step, etc.). You can make your own or find them on many websites like Thingiverse, Printer World, or Printables.
  * We’ll be making our own!
A slicer program converts the 3D object file into g-code, the language of 3D printers.
The 3D printer interprets the g-code into the movement several stepper motors and heating elements to do the 3D printing.
